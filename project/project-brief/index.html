    <h1>Project Brief: Sound Feels 💕</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Topic Summary:</h2>
    <p>The topic for our project is “Sound for Healing”. This is an interesting topic because sound is all around
      us and sometimes it can add to our anxiety and stress levels. However, though our project, we hope to create
       a space where users can come and play, de-stress and make some of their own noise through our website. Research
       suggests art therapy is an effective tool against mental illness and we hope to create a fun and engaging creative
       space that people can use to feel better. </p>

    <h2>Target Audience Description:</h2>
    <p>For our project, the audience that we hope to reach are college students who are just like us. A stressed-out college
      student is an ideal user because they have a lot of stress having to deal with the pressure of school, work, and their
      personal lives. Also, college students like to continue to further their education. Our website will provide them with
      a space where they can come to de-stress, but also continue to learn. Our perfect match is a tech-savvy youth with mild
      anxiety who could benefit from a bit of intentional distraction and exploration in their day. </p>

    <h2>Goals of the Project:</h2>
    <p>The ultimate goal for this project in this class, is to create an interactive website that functions and allows users to
       engage with the content. Sound Feels 💕 is a website that users can utilize to take a break from their stressful daily lives.
       The website will include fun and distracting games as well as well as educational materials around the topic of sound. Our project
       aims to provide a creative space where users can use sound for a healing purpose. Essentially, we are creating a space that people
       can engage with as an art therapy space with sound as the primary tool to heal. Sound Feels will be a website where people can use
       sound for healing. </p>

    <h2>Goals of the Overall Look & Feel:</h2>
    <p>Our project will use a neutral color scheme that welcomes users in in a friendly way. We will have fun typographic characters through
      the uses of emoji. The emojis we will use include: 💕 💓 🎧 🎤. These emoji’s will engage our primary user base, who use them on a daily basis, by allowing them to feel that the website 
      was built to be used by people in their age range. Our typography will include short pieces of information in a playful typeface. Users will be
      able to interact with our website through click events, audio and visual input. We will use hovers on our buttons so that the user will understand
      which items are clickable and what is not. </p>
