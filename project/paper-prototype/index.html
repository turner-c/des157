        <h1>Paper Protype</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Round 1</h2>
        <p>Below you will find the images that are my paper prototypes from the first round of sharing.</p>

            <figcaption>This is the second page of my website that users would be sent to once they hit enter from the splash page. Some of the feedback I recieved from this page of my prototype was if the link was clickable or not.</figcaption>

            <img src="images/ear.png" alt="Good Vibrations Splash Page" width="542" height="368">
            <figcaption>This is the informational page. This portion of the website is meant to educate. The button "See How You Feel" was added in the second iterations of the paper prototype, it was not there in this first round. Some of the feedback I recieved
                from this page of my prototype was what happens when you click on the ear, or is it even clickable.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Other Feedback From Round 1</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What does the community link in the Nav do?</li>
            <li>The Home Page should look differnt then the internal experience pages of the website.</li>
            <li>Can you make the iPad vibrate?</li>

            <figcaption>Based on the feedback from Round 1, I chose to change my homepage. I am still considering if the quote is clickable and what happens if it is clicked. I have added the navigation buttons that send you to the differnt pages that users can experience.</figcaption>

        <h3>Other Feedback From Round 2</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It is important to pay attention to the amount of clicks that a user will have to make in order to navigate to a particular webpage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To deal with this amount of feedback I may want to eliminate the Splash Page.</p>
